# CertificateGenerator
Generates personalized Python course completion certificate PDFs using input data of names and achievement levels from a CSV file. Created using Google Colab as a project for the Python course at the NASA SEES summer high school intern program.

The ExampleFiles folder contains an example input CSV file, an example output PDF certificate, as well as screenshot of the example output PDF (shown below).

Here's an example certificate:
